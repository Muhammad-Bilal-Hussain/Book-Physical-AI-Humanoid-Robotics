# Tasks: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Robotics

**Feature**: 004-vla-robotics  
**Date**: 2026-01-09  
**Status**: Draft

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation tasks for Module 4 of "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" titled "Vision-Language-Action (VLA)". The module focuses on the convergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), computer vision, and robotic control, enabling humanoid robots to understand natural language and execute physical actions.

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation will follow a phased approach with the following priorities:
1. **MVP Scope**: Complete User Story 1 (Understanding VLA as core paradigm) as the foundational content
2. **Incremental Delivery**: Add chapters in sequence (Paradigm → Voice-to-Action → LLM Planning → Capstone)
3. **Quality Assurance**: Ensure all content meets academic standards with proper citations
4. **Capstone Integration**: Maintain strong connections to previous modules and conclude the book effectively

## Dependencies

- **Module 1**: ROS 2 concepts (prerequisite knowledge)
- **Module 2**: Digital Twin Simulation (prerequisite knowledge)
- **Module 3**: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac) (immediate prerequisite)
- **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) (this module - capstone of the book)

## Parallel Execution Examples

- Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 can be researched in parallel
- Citation gathering can happen alongside content writing
- Readability assessment can be performed on completed chapters while others are in progress
