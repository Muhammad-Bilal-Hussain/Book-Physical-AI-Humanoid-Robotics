# Prompt History Record

## Original Prompt

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response Summary

Created a comprehensive feature specification for Module 2 of the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" book titled "The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)". The specification includes:

- User scenarios for learning digital twin concepts, Gazebo physics simulation, Unity visualization, sensor simulation, and complete simulation environments
- Functional requirements covering educational objectives, content structure, readability standards, and citation requirements
- Success criteria with measurable outcomes for student comprehension and satisfaction
- A quality checklist to validate the specification completeness

The specification follows the template structure and focuses on educational content for advanced undergraduate and graduate students in robotics, AI, and mechatronics.

## Outcome

The specification is complete and ready for the next phase of planning. All mandatory sections have been filled, requirements are testable and unambiguous, and success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic.
