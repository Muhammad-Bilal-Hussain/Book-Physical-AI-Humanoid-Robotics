# Prompt History Record

## Original Prompt

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response Summary

Generated a comprehensive task list for the Digital Twin Simulation module (Module 2 of "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics"). The tasks are organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing:

1. Phase 1: Setup tasks for project initialization
2. Phase 2: Foundational tasks for core infrastructure
3. Phase 3: User Story 1 - Understanding Digital Twin Concepts (P1 priority)
4. Phase 4: User Story 2 - Learning Gazebo Physics Simulation (P1 priority)
5. Phase 5: User Story 3 - Exploring Unity Visualization (P2 priority)
6. Phase 6: User Story 4 - Understanding Sensor Simulation (P2 priority)
7. Phase 7: User Story 5 - Creating Complete Simulation Environments (P3 priority)
8. Phase 8: Polish and cross-cutting concerns

Each task follows the required checklist format with IDs, story labels, and specific file paths. The tasks align with the functional requirements from the specification and incorporate the entities from the data model.

## Outcome

The tasks.md file is complete and ready for implementation. It contains 50+ specific tasks organized by user story priority, with clear dependencies and parallel execution opportunities. Each task includes specific file paths and follows the required format for traceability and execution.
