# Tasks Created: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Robotics

## Summary
Created comprehensive task breakdown for Module 4 of the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" book titled "Vision-Language-Action (VLA)". The tasks follow a phased approach organized by user stories to enable independent implementation and testing.

## Key Details
- **Feature**: 004-vla-robotics (Vision-Language-Action Robotics)
- **Total Tasks**: 59 tasks across 7 phases
- **User Stories**: 4 prioritized stories (P1, P2, P3, P4)
- **Chapters**: 4 planned chapters covering VLA Paradigm, Voice-to-Action, LLM Planning, and Autonomous Humanoid

## Task Distribution
- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: 5 tasks
- **Phase 2 (Foundation)**: 5 tasks
- **Phase 3 (US1 - VLA Paradigm)**: 8 tasks [US1]
- **Phase 4 (US2 - Voice-to-Action)**: 9 tasks [US2]
- **Phase 5 (US3 - LLM Planning)**: 10 tasks [US3]
- **Phase 6 (US4 - Autonomous Humanoid)**: 10 tasks [US4]
- **Phase 7 (Polish)**: 12 tasks

## Implementation Strategy
- **MVP Scope**: Complete User Story 1 (Understanding VLA as core paradigm) as foundational content
- **Incremental Delivery**: Add chapters in sequence (Paradigm → Voice-to-Action → LLM Planning → Capstone)
- **Quality Assurance**: Tasks include citation, readability, and plagiarism checks
- **Capstone Integration**: Final tasks ensure strong connection to previous modules and conclude the book

## Independent Test Criteria
- **US1**: Students can explain VLA as a core paradigm in Physical AI
- **US2**: Students can trace the language → plan → perception → action flow
- **US3**: Students can explain how LLMs contribute to robotic decision-making
- **US4**: Students can explain the architecture of an autonomous humanoid system

## Parallel Opportunities
- Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 research can happen in parallel
- Citation gathering can occur alongside content writing
- Readability assessment can be performed on completed chapters while others are in progress

## Compliance Verification
- All tasks follow required checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, descriptions)
- User story tasks properly labeled ([US1], [US2], [US3], [US4])
- Technical requirements mapped to specific tasks
- Dependencies and prerequisites clearly identified

## Next Steps
Ready to begin implementation following the phased approach, starting with setup tasks (T001-T005) and foundational content (T006-T010).
