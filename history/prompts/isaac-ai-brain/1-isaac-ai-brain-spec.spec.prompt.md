# Feature Specification Created: Isaac AI Robot Brain

## Summary
Created a comprehensive feature specification for Module 3 of the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" book titled "The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)". The specification covers educational content about NVIDIA Isaac as the intelligence layer for humanoid robots, focusing on simulation, perception, and navigation.

## Key Details
- **Feature Branch**: 003-isaac-ai-brain
- **Target Audience**: Advanced undergraduate and graduate-level students in AI, Robotics, Computer Vision, and Autonomous Systems
- **Module Focus**: NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, Visual SLAM, and Nav2 framework
- **Planned Chapters**: 4 chapters covering simulation to navigation
- **Learning Outcomes**: Students understand Isaac's role in Physical AI, synthetic data pipelines, and perception-to-navigation flow

## Specification Highlights
- 14 functional requirements defined
- 8 measurable success criteria established
- 3 user stories with acceptance scenarios
- Dependencies on Modules 1 and 2, connection to Module 4
- Compliance with APA citation standards and readability requirements

## Validation
- Specification validated against quality checklist
- All requirements met and marked as complete
- Ready for planning phase (/sp.plan)

## Prompt Text
Project: Module 3 of the book "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" titled: "The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)" Context: This module introduces NVIDIA Isaac as the intelligence layer enabling perception, navigation, and learning in humanoid robots, building upon ROS 2 and simulation-based Digital Twins. Target Audience: Advanced undergraduate and graduate-level students in: - Artificial Intelligence - Robotics - Computer Vision - Autonomous Systems Module Focus: - NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation - Isaac ROS for hardware-accelerated perception and VSLAM - Nav2 framework for humanoid navigation and path planning Learning Outcomes (Success Criteria): - Reader understands the role of NVIDIA Isaac in Physical AI systems - Reader can conceptually explain synthetic data pipelines - Reader understands perception-to-navigation flow in humanoid robots - Reader can connect simulation, perception, and navigation into a unified AI-robot brain Content Requirements: - 3–4 chapters only (no sub-chapters) - Chapters must follow a logical progression from simulation to navigation - No implementation tutorials or setup guides Planned Chapters: 1. NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Synthetic Data Generation 2. Isaac ROS and Hardware-Accelerated Perception 3. Visual SLAM for Humanoid Robots 4. Nav2 Path Planning for Bipedal Navigation Citation & Evidence Standards: - APA citation style - Minimum 8–10 sources - At least 50% peer-reviewed sources - Remaining sources from official NVIDIA and ROS documentation - All claims must be verifiable Writing & Style Constraints: - Format: Markdown (MD/MDX) for Docusaurus - Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level 10–12 - Zero plagiarism tolerance Not Building: - Installation instructions - Full code walkthroughs - Hardware-specific tuning - Reinforcement learning deep dives Timeline: - Designed to be completed within 1 week during hackathon development Output Expectations: - Docusaurus-compatible Markdown files - Clean chapter hierarchy - Inline APA citations and references - Natural transition to Module 4 (Vision-Language-Action)
