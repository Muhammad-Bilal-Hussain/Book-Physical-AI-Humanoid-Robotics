This document outlines the content guidelines to ensure all materials in Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) meet the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level 10-12 standard.

## Reading Level Standards

All content must maintain a Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level between 10 and 12 to ensure accessibility for advanced undergraduate and graduate-level learners.

### Key Metrics:
- **Flesch Reading Ease**: Target range of 40-50
- **Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level**: Target range of 10-12
- **Sentence Length**: Average 15-20 words per sentence
- **Paragraph Length**: 5-8 sentences per paragraph

## Writing Guidelines

### Vocabulary
- Use technical terms appropriately but define them clearly
- Limit jargon and acronyms; spell out on first use
- Choose active voice over passive voice when possible
- Use concrete rather than abstract language when possible
