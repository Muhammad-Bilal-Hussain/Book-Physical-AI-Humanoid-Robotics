# Glossary: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Robotics

## Key Terms and Definitions

- **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: The paradigm integrating visual perception, language understanding, and physical action execution in robotics.

- **Large Language Model (LLM)**: AI models capable of understanding and generating human language, used for high-level reasoning in robotics.

- **Embodied AI**: AI systems that interact with the physical world through robotic bodies, combining perception, cognition, and action.

- **Cognitive Robotics**: A field that applies cognitive science principles to robotics, focusing on higher-level reasoning and decision-making.

- **Multimodal Learning**: Machine learning that processes and integrates information from multiple sensory modalities (e.g., vision, language, audio).

- **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: The process of converting spoken language into written text, often using models like OpenAI's Whisper.

- **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)**: Technology that converts speech into text, forming the basis for voice-controlled systems.

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: A field of AI focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

- **Perception-Action Loop**: The continuous cycle in robotics involving sensing the environment, processing information, and executing actions.

- **Symbolic Grounding**: The process of connecting abstract symbols (e.g., words) to concrete sensory experiences or physical actions.

- **Hierarchical Planning**: A planning approach that decomposes complex tasks into subtasks at different levels of abstraction.

- **Adaptive Autonomy**: A system design where the level of automation adjusts based on context, task complexity, or operator state.

- **Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)**: The study of interactions between humans and robots, focusing on design and implementation of robotic systems for human use.

- **ROS 2 Action Mapping**: The process of translating high-level commands into specific ROS 2 action executions for robotic systems.
