# Chapter 5: Integration - Creating Complete Simulation Environments

This chapter focuses on integrating all components covered in previous chapters to create comprehensive simulation environments for humanoid robots. We'll explore how to combine Gazebo physics simulation, Unity visualization, and ROS 2 communication to build cohesive environments where humanoid robots can be tested, trained, and validated before real-world deployment.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
- Design integrated simulation environments combining Gazebo and Unity
- Implement ROS 2 messaging for communication between simulation components
- Create complete simulation workflows for humanoid robot testing
- Understand data flow architecture in integrated environments
- Apply validation techniques for integrated simulation systems
- Bridge simulation results to real-world robot deployment
