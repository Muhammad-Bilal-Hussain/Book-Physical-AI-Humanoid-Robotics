# Glossary: Digital Twin Simulation for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

This glossary defines key terms used throughout Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity).

## Key Terms

**Digital Twin**: A virtual representation of a physical robot that mirrors its real-world counterpart in behavior and characteristics.

**Sim-to-Real Gap**: The difference between behaviors observed in simulation versus reality.

**Physics Engine**: Software that simulates physical phenomena like gravity, collisions, and dynamics for realistic robot interaction.

**Sensor Simulation**: The process of generating synthetic data that mimics real sensor outputs.

**ROS 2 Integration**: Using ROS 2 as middleware to connect simulation components.

**Unity Robotics**: Using Unity for robotics simulation, visualization, and human-robot interaction.

**Gazebo**: A physics-based simulation engine commonly used in robotics for simulating robots in realistic indoor and outdoor environments.

**URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**: An XML format for representing a robot model in ROS.

**LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)**: A remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure distances.

**IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)**: A device that measures and reports a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the magnetic field surrounding the body.

**HRI (Human-Robot Interaction)**: The field of study dedicated to understanding, designing, and evaluating robotic systems for human interaction.

**Simulation Environment**: A virtual space where physical laws and sensor behaviors are modeled to test robotic systems.

**Collision Detection**: The computational problem of detecting the intersection of two or more objects in a simulation.

**Dynamics Simulation**: The simulation of how forces affect the movement of objects in a robotic system.

**Synthetic Data**: Artificially generated data that mimics real-world data for training AI models.

**Perception Training**: The process of training AI systems to interpret sensory data from the environment.
