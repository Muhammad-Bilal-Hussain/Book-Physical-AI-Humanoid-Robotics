# Glossary: Isaac AI Robot Brain

## Key Terms and Definitions

- **Isaac Sim**: NVIDIA's simulation environment for robotics, providing photorealistic rendering and synthetic data generation capabilities.

- **Isaac ROS**: Hardware-accelerated perception and manipulation libraries that bridge NVIDIA's AI and robotics technologies with the Robot Operating System (ROS).

- **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**: The computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within it.

- **Nav2**: The ROS 2 navigation framework that provides path planning, obstacle avoidance, and robot movement capabilities.

- **Synthetic Data**: Artificially generated data that mimics real-world data, commonly used for training machine learning models when real data is scarce or expensive to acquire.

- **Domain Randomization**: A technique used in simulation to improve the transfer learning from simulation to reality by varying the simulation parameters randomly.

- **Hardware Acceleration**: The use of specialized hardware (like GPUs) to perform specific tasks more efficiently than general-purpose CPUs.

- **Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO)**: A method for estimating the position and orientation of a robot by combining visual information from cameras with inertial measurements from IMU sensors.

- **Loop Closure**: A process in SLAM where the system recognizes a previously visited location and corrects accumulated drift in the map.

- **Costmap**: A representation of the environment used in navigation systems where each cell contains a value representing the cost of traversing that area.

- **Behavior Trees**: A mathematical model of plan execution used in robotics and AI to organize the execution of tasks in a hierarchical manner.

- **Graph-Based Execution**: A computational paradigm used in Isaac where processing nodes are connected in a graph to optimize data flow and processing efficiency.

- **Simulation-to-Reality Transfer**: The process of transferring skills or models learned in simulation to real-world robotic systems.

- **GPU Embedded Multimedia Streaming (GEMS)**: Isaac ROS modules that provide optimized multimedia streaming capabilities for robotics applications.
