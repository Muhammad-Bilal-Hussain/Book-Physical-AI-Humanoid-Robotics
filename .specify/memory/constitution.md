# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### Technical Accuracy
Technical accuracy verified against primary and authoritative sources

### Clear Structured Explanations
Clear, structured explanations suitable for an academic and engineering audience

### Reproducibility
All architectural designs, algorithms, and workflows must be explainable and traceable

### Engineering Rigor
Engineering rigor with emphasis on real-world robotics systems

### Spec-Driven Development
Spec-driven development aligned with Spec-Kit Plus methodology

### Zero Plagiarism Tolerance
Zero plagiarism tolerance (content must be original and rewritten, not copied)

## Key Standards
All factual and technical claims must be traceable to cited sources. Citation format: APA style. Source requirements: Minimum 50% peer-reviewed sources (journals, conference papers), Remaining sources may include official documentation (ROS 2, NVIDIA Isaac, Gazebo, Unity, OpenAI). Writing clarity: Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level 10–12. Code examples must be minimal, correct, and concept-focused.

## Book Structure Constraints
Total length: Equivalent to a short technical book (not a single article). Each module must contain: Conceptual foundation, System architecture explanation, Practical workflow or example. Modules must follow the specified 4-module structure covering The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2), The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity), The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac), and Vision-Language-Action (VLA).

## Governance
All content must be compatible with Docusaurus Markdown (MD/MDX), Clear headings, diagrams described textually, and code blocks where relevant, Designed for GitHub Pages deployment, Citations embedded inline and listed in references sections per module, All technical claims are verifiable and properly cited, Book reads as a cohesive, professional robotics textbook, No plagiarism detected, Content passes technical review by a robotics or AI engineer, Aligns with hackathon requirements and demonstrates Physical AI mastery
